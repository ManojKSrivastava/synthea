The simulation configuration files in this directory can be used to execute a single run of a Synthea physiology model via the gradle command line interface. The configuration allows manipulation of the differential equation solver, step size, sim duration, and configuration for output charts if desired. Output files will be in the {\ttfamily output/physiology} directory.

Note that these are only utilized for the physiology gradle command and are not part of the normal Synthea execution procedure.\hypertarget{md_config_simulations_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{md_config_simulations_README_autotoc_md8}
